## Hardware
(Special Thanks to Jeff Zhao for showing me this [blog post](http://blog.cyrusroshan.com/2016/01/02/a-hardware-hackers-kit) by [CyrusRoshan](https://github.com/CyrusRoshan). Totally copied most of the hardware list from him.)

### Basics
- [ ] Dev Board (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Edison, Photon, etc.)
- [ ] Cables
- [ ] Breadboards
- [ ] Jumper Wires/Alligator Clips
- [ ] Resistors

### Tools
- [ ] Needle Nose Pliers
- [ ] Wire Cutters
- [ ] Screwdrivers
- [ ] Superglue
- [ ] Electric Tape
- [ ] Zipties
- [ ] Multimeter

### I/O

##### Small Components
- [ ] LEDs
- [ ] Photoresistors
- [ ] Reflective IR
- [ ] IR Transmitter/Reciever LEDs
- [ ] Transistors
- [ ] Capacitors
- [ ] Piezos
- [ ] Humidity sensor
- [ ] Temperature sensor
- [ ] Hall sensors
- [ ] Vibration Motors
- [ ] Tilt/vibration sensors
- [ ] DC Motors
- [ ] Push button switches
- [ ] Flex sensors (a bit more expensive, I’d only get one)
- [ ] Force sensitive resistors (same as above)

##### Large Components
- [ ] Servos
- [ ] Pulse sensor
- [ ] Ultrasonic range sensors
- [ ] Gyro/Accelerometer (usually have both on the same breakout board)
- [ ] LCD screen (preferably with I2C for less wires)
- [ ] Bluetooth module (you’ll need one with BLE support for iPhones)

##### Additional Power
- [ ] Relay module
- [ ] Breadboard psu
- [ ] 9v Batteries (for powering motors that needs more power. Use with transistor to switch on/off)
- [ ] Rechargeable power bank (for when you want to power your dev board without a laptop)

## ToDos
- [ ] Update OS, IDEs, and all other software
- [ ] Confirm venue location and time
- [ ] Confirm transportation arrangements
- [ ] Set multiple alarms and get a good nights sleep!
